# Python-modules

**PYTHON DECORATORS
* Decorators are a feature that adds functionality to an existing piece of code.
* They act as a wrapper to an existing function, modifying its behavior.
* Also called as metaprogramming, The wrapping action happens at the compile time.

**PYTHON MODULES
* Python Modules are collection of python files placed in one DIRECTORY 
(With No Spaces), This DIRECTORY name becomes the modules name.
To use a module, it must be "imported" using the "import" clause, in a 
python file.

**PYTHON DATETIME
* *date* module use this module to get the current date or details of the
  date like month, day, year.
  
**PYTHON TIME
* To work with date and time in python, import either time or datetime module.
* The `time` module is used for working with unix epoch time
* The `datetime` module is used for working with general date and time, 
  TimeZones and Timestamps
  
**PYTHON REGEX
Regular Expressions are string patterns to search in other strings
* PYTHON Regular Expressions, functionality is provided by the "re" MODULE
* Regular expressions is all about matching a "pattern" in a "string"
* search() function, returns true or false for the string found / not found
* findall() function, returns a TUPLE of all occurrences of the pattern
* sub() function, This is used to replace parts of strings, with a pattern
* split() function, seperates a string by space or any dilimeter.
  
**PYTHON COLLECTIONS
* Python Collections are data structures to store data, Similar to the built-ins
* like list, dict, set, tuple etc. These module based collections provide
* additional features. They are part of the **collections** module.
* Python collection modules are counter, default dict, ordered dict, dq, chainmap, named tuple

**PYTHON SERIALIZER
* Serialization is the process of converting an object state into a 
  binary file, this file can be stored on filesystem or transmitted across
  network or it can be persisted(stored) and later use.
* Serialization of an object is also known as deflating or marshalling.
* In Python we use the **PICKLE** module to Serialize an Object.
* In order to resurrect an Object from a Pickle file it needs to be deserialized
* Deserialization of a file into an object also known as inflating or 
  unmarshalling.
